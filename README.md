📚 DSA-Training

Repo to contain all the classroom LeetCode questions and solutions 💻✍️

This repository is a personal collection of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice problems and solutions that I’ve solved as part of classroom exercises, coding practice, and interview preparation. It’s aimed at solidifying DSA concepts and building a strong coding foundation.

📂 Folder Structure

Each folder in this repo groups problems by topic or pattern, such as:

📁 Arrays
📁 Two pointer
📁 Basic Easy lvl


Inside each folder, you’ll find solutions organized by difficulty and problem type.
This makes it easier to find, practice, and review problems while preparing for interviews or exams.
